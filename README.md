# scRNAseq In hiPSC-derived Oligodendroglial Cultures
This is a repository for all code used for analyses shown in Raabe et al. (in preparation) "Transcription factor-dependent differences in cluster composition and transition states of oligodendrocyte differentiation from human stem cells".
It contains all scripts used for data analysis and plotting in the publications scRNAseq part.

The analysis pipeline consists of three main parts:
1. Processing of the raw sequencing data (preprocessing)
2. scRNAseq data analysis in Seurat (v3 on R 4.0.1; R)
3. Comparison with a bulkRNAseq dataset from primary tissue (R)
4. RNA velocity analysis (Python & R)
