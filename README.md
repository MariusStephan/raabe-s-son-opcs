This is a repository for all code used for analyses shown in Raabe et al. (in preparation) "Transcription factor-dependent differences in cluster composition and transition states of oligodendrocyte differentiation from human stem cells".
It contains scripts for sequencing data processing, scRNAseq analysis and RNA velocity analysis.

Code will be added upon submission.
Stay tuned!
